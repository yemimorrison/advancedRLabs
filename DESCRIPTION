Description: The package contains two algorithms, namely the Euclidean and Dijkstra algorithms.
    The Euclidean algorithm is designed to find the greatest common divisor of two integers.
    The Dijkstra algorithm is designed to calculate the shortest path from the initial 
    node to every other node in the graph and returns the result as a vector.
